PHMK ePubs also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://phmkepubs.tk blog posts. PHMK ePubs only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
